# React Dynamic Geometry

A dynamic geometry library built on top of [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) and [Jotai](https://github.com/pmndrs/jotai). Easily create geometry "boards" with dynamic elements.

## WARNING

This project is still in the phase of "just playing around". I'm having fun building out geometric constructs, but do have plans to make this a more serious project once a few more ideas are fleshed out.

## Feedback Welcome

Does this thing interest you? Hit me up! I want to hear your ideas.
